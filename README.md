### Summary

We practiced using CSS by building a Google Clone. Another challenge was to utilize media queries and CSS Flexbox to build a responsive design regarding the presentation of images. This challenge is in the pinterest-responsive folder. The idea was to present 6 images in a single column. When the screen is between 640px and 960px, display 3 rows of two images. Over 960px, display 2 rows of 3 images.
